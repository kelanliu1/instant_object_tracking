# Tiny Sieve

Sieve Challenge:
This project is a mini version of Sieve that allows users to send a video, process the video, and retrieve the information that has been processed. The project is implemented in Python using the Flask framework.

## Running the Project

1. Run the Flask app by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```python main.py```

This will start the Flask development server, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (also accessible via `http://localhost:5000/`).

2. Keep the Flask app running while testing it with the `test.py` script. Open another terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and activate the virtual environment as described in the Setup section.

3. Run the test script by executing the following command:

```python test.py```

This script will send HTTP requests to the Flask app endpoints and display the responses in the terminal or command prompt.
